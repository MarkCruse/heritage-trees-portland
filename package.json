  "description": "The first part of Module 02 (Geoprocessing with Node) introduced you to Node and npm, a server-side JavaScript framework. We learned how to install packages globally using the `-g` flag, such as live-server and mapshaper, which can then be used from any location on the computer system. We also used how to initialize an npm project for a specific program and track packages installed locally using the **package.json** file. We then wrote several Node scripts for processing JSON and CSV data to produce web-ready GeoJSON files.",
